# CFU Sample Driver
The sample CFU driver is based on the Microsoft Devices Driver Module Framework (DMF). This folder contains:
    Sample CFU driver (ComponentFirmwareUpdateDriver) and 
    Examples of adopting the driver to enable firmware update scenarios using the componentized and monolothic packaging techniques.

Two Scenarios are:
1. A Laptop MCU Firmware Update, to update a MCU and it's 2 sub-components, in a hypothetical laptop.
2. A Dock Firmware Update, to update a MCU and its sub-component, in a hypothetical Dock.

# Folders

ComponentFirmwareUpdateDriver: Sample CFU Driver  
ComponentizedPackageExample: 2 Examples based on Componentized Packages which uses Extension INF.
MonolithicPackageExample: 2 Examples monolothic Packages.
DMF: This folder should contain the DMF source code.
